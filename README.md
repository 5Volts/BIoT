# Smart Window Blinds

Basically I have these window blinds in my room that can be lowered via pulling a string right here. So instead, I wanted to attach that string to a specially designed motor so that I could control it electronically. My goal is to possibly control my blinds through Internet Of Things and potentially with Google Assitant and so on.
